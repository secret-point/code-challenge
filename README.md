## Acceptance Criteria 
- Your code repository is a private GitHub repository forked from `git@github.com:uao-outstanding-workplace/code-challenge.git`
- The cloned project must be named `uao-<PERSONAL_CODE>`, where `<PERSONAL_CODE>` is provided by a UAO! recruiter
- Invite UAO! Outstanding Workplace as a project contributor 

Once received your project invitation from GitHub: 
- We will clone the GitHub project from the last commit before the due date 
- We will run `docker-compose up` from the root folder of the project
- We will evaluate: 
  - User Experience 
  - Software Design: SOLID principles, TDD, Software Engineering
  - Data Model
